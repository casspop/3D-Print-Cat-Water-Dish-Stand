# 3D-Print-Cat-Water-Dish-Stand

Our cat is old.  This stand holds the cat's water dish at a height that makes it easier for her to drink.  That makes sense because the angle of attack is improved.  She can lap the water without it getting splashed into her nose.  I think if I were a cat, I'd like that better.

The legs slide into slots in the upper horizontal brace.  It's a snug fit.  After defacing it a bit by using the wrong tools, I used a rubber mallet and a plastic torpedo level to tap the bracket down until it touched the stop on each leg.

The bottom horizontal bracket is not really necessary, but it does provide some structural strength as well as making it look more finished.  I used M3 x 4mm sheet metal screws with a washer.  You can use a longer screw like a M3 x 6mm if you want.  

I always use stainless steel where I can, especially on something like this that is in the vicinity of water.

The stand holds the bowl 90mm off the floor.  

This stand is made for a Pyrex 950ml (1qt/4-cup) bowl that you find with the 7201 lid nearly everywhere.
